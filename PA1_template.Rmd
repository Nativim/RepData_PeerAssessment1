## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
# Data has been downloaded to the working directory first. Load and inspection of the data

activity <- read.csv("./activity.csv")

head(activity)

summary(activity)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
# Aggregation of the data to plot on a histogram

steps_daily <- with(activity, aggregate(steps, by = list(date), FUN = sum, na.rm = TRUE))

names(steps_daily) <- c("date", "steps")


hist(steps_daily$steps, main = "Total number of steps per day", xlab = "Total steps per day", col = "orange", 
ylim = c(0,25), breaks = seq(0,25000, by=2500))

#Calculate mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day
mean(steps_daily$steps)

median(steps_daily$steps)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

```{r}
# Aggregation of the data to plot on a linear graph
average_activity <- aggregate(activity$steps, by=list(activity$interval), FUN=mean, na.rm=TRUE)

names(average_activity) <- c("interval", "mean")

plot(average_activity$interval, average_activity$mean, type = "l", col="red", lwd = 2, 
xlab="Interval", ylab="Average number of steps", main="Average number of steps per intervals")
```

## Imputing missing values
```{r}
#Calculate the total number of missing values in the dataset. 

sum(is.na(activity$steps))

#Fill the missing values with the average
steps <- average_activity$mean[match(activity$interval, average_activity$interval)]

#Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in and plot on a histogram
complete_activity <- transform(activity, steps = ifelse(is.na(activity$steps), yes = steps, no= activity$steps))

total_steps <- aggregate(steps ~ date, complete_activity, sum)

names(total_steps) <- c("date", "daily_steps")


hist(total_steps$daily_steps, col = "orange", xlab = "Total steps per day", ylim = c(0,30), 
main = "Total number of steps per day", breaks = seq(0,25000,by=2500))

#Calculate mean and median
mean(total_steps$daily_steps)

median(total_steps$daily_steps)
```

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

```{r}
#Add a new column for the day of the week and other for the day type
activity$date <- as.Date(strptime(activity$date, format="%Y-%m-%d"))

weekday <- weekdays(activity$date)

day_type <- sapply(activity$date, function(x) {
  if (weekdays(x) == "Saturday" | weekdays(x) =="Sunday") 
  {y <- "Weekend"} else 
  {y <- "Weekday"}
  y
})

activity_day <- cbind(activity,weekday, day_type)

#Aggregate and make a panel plot containing a time series plot. Install ggplot if not already installed
install.packages('ggplot2')
library('ggplot2')

activity_day_type <- aggregate(steps~interval + day_type, activity_day, mean, na.rm=TRUE)

ggplot(activity_day_type) + geom_line(aes(x=interval, y=steps, color=day_type)) +
  labs(title = "Average daily steps by day type", x = "Interval", y = "Average number of steps")+
  facet_wrap(~day_type, ncol = 1, nrow=2)
